This system utilizes an autonomous agent workflow (e.g., using CrewAI or LangGraph) to analyze candidate resumes against a specific job description. 
Instead of simple keyword matching, the agents act as intelligent recruiters.
They evaluate nuanced skills, quantify experience relevance, and generate a ranked list of the top candidates (e.g., Top 5 or 10) based on deep semantic understanding.


Collaboration Tips:
- Divide features between frontend/backend or by components
